# Part 3

Part 2 was doing the statistical disclosure attack on the public nodes.  Now, for Part 3, we have to do the attack on the private nodes.
  These nodes are pretty much the same except you cannot directly connect to them and listen, so you have to base your SENDER and
  RECEIVER on the public nodes that propogate messages first, then connect them back to the private nodes.
